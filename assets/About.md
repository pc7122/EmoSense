EmoSense is an emotion recognition app that can detect emotions from images, audio, and video.
It is built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
The image model is trained using the [FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013) dataset
and the audio model is trained using the [RAVDESS](https://www.kaggle.com/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio), [SAVEE](https://www.kaggle.com/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio), [CREMA](https://www.kaggle.com/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio) dataset.
For video, the app uses the image model to detect emotions from each frame of the video in realtime.
